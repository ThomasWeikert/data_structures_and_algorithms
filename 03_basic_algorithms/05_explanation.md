**Implementation**


This code defines a Trie data structure and uses it to find all the words with a given prefix from a list of words. The TrieNode class represents a single node in the Trie, and the Trie class represents the Trie itself, with functions to insert words into the Trie and find the node that represents a given prefix. The suffixes method is a recursive function that collects the suffixes for all complete words below a given node.

The code then creates a MyTrie object and inserts a list of words into it. The f function is used to interactively find all words in the Trie that have a given prefix using the interact function from the ipywidgets library.



**Concept**


A Trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used to store a collection of strings, such as words in a dictionary or a list of search terms. Each node in the tree represents a character, and the edges represent the possible next characters in the strings.

Here's a simple example of a Trie with three words: "cat", "car", and "dog":



```
        (root)
         /   \
        c     d
       / \     
      a   o
     /     \
    t       g
    |
    r
```


The root of the Trie has no character value, and its children are the possible first characters of the strings. In this case, the root has two children, "c" and "d", representing the first letters of the words "cat" and "dog".

The next level of the Trie represents the second letter of the words. The "c" node has two children, "a" and "o", representing the second letters of the words "cat" and "car". The "d" node has one child, "o", representing the second letter of the word "dog".

The next level represents the third letter of the words. The "a" node has one child, "t", representing the third letter of the word "cat". The "o" node has one child, "g", representing the third letter of the word "dog". The "r" node represents the third letter of the word "car", but it is also a leaf node, indicating that "car" is a complete word in the Trie.

To check if a word is in the Trie, we start at the root and follow the edges corresponding to each letter of the word. If we reach a leaf node, the word is in the Trie. If we reach a node with no corresponding edge for the next letter, the word is not in the Trie.

The Trie data structure is useful for quickly finding all words with a given prefix. To do this, we start at the root and follow the edges corresponding to each letter of the prefix. We then recursively collect all the complete words from the subtree rooted at the prefix node. For example, to find all words with the prefix "ca", we would start at the "c" node, follow the edge to the "a" node, and recursively collect all complete words from the subtree rooted at the "a" node, which would be "cat" and "car".


**Time and space complexity**
The time complexity for inserting a word into the trie is O(k), where k is the length of the word being inserted. For finding the node that represents a prefix, the time complexity is also O(k), where k is the length of the prefix. Finally, the time complexity for the suffixes method is O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the trie. This is because the method needs to visit every node in the trie once to collect the suffixes.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n*m), where n is the number of words in the trie and m is the length of the longest word. This is because the trie needs to store each character in each word, and each node in the trie represents a single character. The space complexity could potentially be reduced by sharing nodes between words that have common prefixes.

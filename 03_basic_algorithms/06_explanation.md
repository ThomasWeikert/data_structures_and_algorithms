This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) because we traverse the list only once, and perform constant-time comparisons and updates for each element in the list. Therefore, this is an efficient algorithm to find both the minimum and maximum values of an unsorted list of integers.

An alternative would be to implement a sorting algorithm such as merge sort that has a time complexity of O(nlogn). We would sort the list in ascending or descending order and return the first and last index as corresponging min or max value.

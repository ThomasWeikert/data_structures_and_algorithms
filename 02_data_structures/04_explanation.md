The active directory problem is a tree-related issue that can be solved using depth-first search. The approach involves 
searching through the users in a group, and if the desired user is not found, then searching through the next level of groups, 
repeating this process until the user is found, through the use of recursion.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * number of groups), where n is the number of users. The space complexity is O(b * 
m), where b is the number of sibling nodes along the longest path in the tree, and m is the length of this longest path.

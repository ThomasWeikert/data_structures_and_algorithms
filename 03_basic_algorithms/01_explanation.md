**Implementation**


This implementation uses a simple algorithm called the Babylonian method to iteratively refine an initial guess for the square root until it converges to the correct value. The algorithm is similar to Newton's method for finding roots of equations.


**Time and space complecity**


The time complexity of the sqrt function implemented using the Babylonian method is O(log n), where n is the input number. This is because the algorithm reduces the error in the guess by a factor of 2 in each iteration, and the number of iterations required to reach a good approximation is proportional to the number of bits in the input number, which is logarithmic in the value of the number.

The space complexity of this implementation is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of memory to store the initial guess and the intermediate calculations during the iteration. Therefore, the space requirements of the function do not depend on the size of the input number.

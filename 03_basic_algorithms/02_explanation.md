To find the index of an element in a rotated sorted array, I can use the binary search algorithm. The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and comparing the middle element with the target element. If the middle element is equal to the target element, then the index of the middle element is returned. Otherwise, if the middle element is greater than the target element, the search is continued on the left half of the array. If the middle element is less than the target element, the search is continued on the right half of the array.

To apply binary search on a rotated sorted array, I need to make some modifications to the algorithm. One approach is to find the pivot element, which is the index of the smallest element in the rotated array. Once I find the pivot element, I can determine which half of the array to perform the binary search on.

To find the pivot element, I can use a modified binary search algorithm. The modified algorithm works by comparing the middle element with the first and last elements of the array to determine which half of the array to search. If the middle element is greater than the first element, the pivot element is in the right half of the array. If the middle element is less than the last element, the pivot element is in the left half of the array. I continue this process until I find the pivot element.

Once I find the pivot element, I can determine which half of the array to perform the binary search on based on the target element. If the target element is greater than or equal to the first element of the array, I search the left half of the array. If the target element is less than the first element of the array, I search the right half of the array.

By using the binary search algorithm on a rotated sorted array, I can achieve a time complexity of O(log n), which is faster than a linear approach.

**Implementation**
The implementation approach for Huffman coding involves two functions: huffman_encoding and huffman_decoding.

The huffman_encoding function takes in a string of data as input and generates a Huffman tree by constructing a frequency table of the characters in the input string and creating a binary code for each character based on its frequency. The function then encodes the input string using the binary codes and returns the encoded string and the Huffman tree as a dictionary.

The huffman_decoding function takes in an encoded string and a Huffman tree as input and decodes the string using the tree to retrieve the original data.

**Time and Space Complexity**
The time complexity of both encoding and decoding operations in the given code is O(n log n) where n is the size of the input data. This is because in the encoding step, the function needs to count the occurrences of each character in the input, which takes O(n) time, and then build a Huffman tree based on the character frequencies, which takes O(n log n) time. In the decoding step, the function needs to traverse the Huffman tree to find the corresponding characters for each code, which takes O(n log n) time.

The space complexity of the code is O(n) because the function needs to store the counts for each character in a dictionary, which takes O(n) space, and also store the Huffman tree and the encoded data, which also takes O(n) space.


**What is Huffmann coding?**
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. It works by assigning variable-length codes to the input characters, based on their frequencies of occurrence. The characters that appear more frequently are assigned shorter codes and the characters that appear less frequently are assigned longer codes. The Huffman tree is a binary tree that is constructed by combining the two least frequent characters into a single node, and iteratively building up the tree until all characters are included. The resulting Huffman tree is used to encode the input data.

**Some applications of Huffman coding**
Data compression: Huffman coding is widely used in data compression algorithms such as gzip and PKZIP, where it is used to reduce the size of files and to increase their transfer speed over the internet.

Text compression: Huffman coding is used in text compression to reduce the size of text files, which can be especially helpful for sending large amounts of text over a network or storing text on a disk.

Image compression: Huffman coding is used in image compression algorithms such as JPEG and PNG, where it is used to reduce the size of images without degrading their quality too much.

Speech and audio compression: Huffman coding is used in speech and audio compression algorithms, where it can be used to compress audio signals to reduce the size of audio files.

DNA sequencing: Huffman coding can also be used in DNA sequencing algorithms to compress DNA sequences, which can be helpful in large-scale sequencing projects.

To create the union of two linked lists, the elements of both linked lists are added to an array, which is then sorted and deduplicated using the set() method. The final linked list is then created from the unique values in the array. The time complexity of this process is O(3n log(n)).

For the intersection of two linked lists, the elements of each linked list are added to separate arrays. A third array is then created to store only the values that appear in both arrays. This third array is again deduplicated and sorted, and the final linked list is created from these unique values. The time complexity of the intersection method is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the larger linked list. The space complexity of both union and intersection methods is O(n), where n is the combined size of the input linked lists.

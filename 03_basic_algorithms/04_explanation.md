**Concept**
The Dutch National Flag problem is a classic computer science problem that involves sorting an array of 0's, 1's, and 2's in linear time and in a single traversal of the array. The problem is to sort an array of integers, each of which can take on the values 0, 1, or 2, such that all the 0's come before all the 1's, and all the 1's come before all the 2's.

The key challenge of this problem is to sort the array in linear time, without using any additional data structures or sorting algorithms that would increase the time complexity. The solution to this problem involves using three pointers to partition the array into three regions: the region containing 0's, the region containing 1's, and the region containing 2's.

Initially, the low and mid pointers are set to the beginning of the array, and the high pointer is set to the end of the array. The mid pointer is used to traverse the array, and the algorithm moves elements into the appropriate region by swapping them with the elements at the low and high pointers.

The algorithm works as follows:

Initialize the low and mid pointers to the first element of the array, and the high pointer to the last element of the array.
Traverse the array with the mid pointer, swapping elements as necessary to maintain the sorting condition. If the element at index mid is 0, swap it with the element at index low and increment both mid and low pointers. If the element at index mid is 1, simply increment the mid pointer. If the element at index mid is 2, swap it with the element at index high and decrement the high pointer.
Continue the traversal until the mid pointer reaches the high pointer, at which point the array will be sorted.
This algorithm works in linear time, because each element is only visited once and is moved to its correct position in constant time. The algorithm also requires no additional memory or sorting algorithms, making it an efficient and practical solution for the Dutch National Flag problem.

**Example**

1.) Initialize low and mid pointers to the first element of the array, and high pointer to the last element of the array:

```low = 0```
```mid = 0```
```high = 5```

2.) Traverse the array with the mid pointer and swap elements as necessary:

- At the beginning, the element at index mid is 0, swap it with the element at index low:

```array before: 012210```
```array after:  012210 (no swap needed because low=mid)```
```low = 0```
```mid = 1```
```high = 5```

- The next element at index mid is 1, which is already in the correct region, so move on to the next element:

```array before: 012210```
```array after:  012210 (no swap needed because mid=1)```
```low = 0```
```mid = 2```
```high = 5```

- The next element at index mid is also 1, which is already in the correct region, so move on to the next element:


```array before: 012210```
```array after:  012210 (no swap needed because mid=2)```
```low = 0```
```mid = 3```
```high = 5```

- The next element at index mid is 2, swap it with the element at index high:

```array before: 012210```
```array after:  012201```
```low = 0```
```mid = 3```
```high = 4```

- The next element at index mid is also 2, swap it with the element at index high:
makefile

```array before: 012201```
```array after:  012201```
```low = 0```
```mid = 3```
```high = 3```

The traversal is complete, and the array is sorted according to the Dutch National Flag problem.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) because we traverse the list only once, and perform constant-time comparisons and updates for each element in the list. Therefore, this is an efficient algorithm to find both the minimum and maximum values of an unsorted list of integers.

An alternative would be to implement a sorting algorithm such as merge sort that has a time complexity of O(nlogn). We would sort the list in ascending or descending order and return the first and last index as corresponging min or max value.

**Time and space complexity**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of integers in the input list. This is because the algorithm iterates through the list once to find the minimum and maximum values.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of memory to store the minimum and maximum values.
